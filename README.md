## 👋 Hi, I’m a DevOps Engineer

I’ve been working in DevOps since **2018**, helping teams design, automate and operate **scalable, reliable cloud infrastructure** across **AWS and Azure**.

I enjoy building systems from the ground up in **startup environments**, where speed, simplicity and reliability matter more than buzzwords.

### 🛠️ What I Work With
- ☁️ **Cloud:** AWS, Azure (multi-cloud)
- 🏗️ **Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform, CloudFormation
- 📦 **Containers & Orchestration:** Docker, Kubernetes, EKS, AKS
- 🔁 **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins
- 📊 **Observability:** Prometheus, Grafana
- 🧰 **Scripting:** Python, Bash

### 🧠 How I Think
- Automation over manual work
- Simple systems over clever ones
- Production-first mindset
- Infrastructure should be reproducible, observable, and secure by default

### 🌍 Outside of Work
When I’m not building or breaking infrastructure, you’ll find me:
- 💪 Training and staying fit
- ✈️ Traveling and exploring new places
